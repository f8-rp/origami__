            <h1>Camel</h1>
            <p>Camels are mammals with long legs, a big-lipped snout and a humped back. There are two types of camels: dromedary camels, which have one hump, and Bactrian camels, which have two humps. Camels' humps consist of stored fat, which they can metabolize when food and water is scarce.</p>

                    <p>Camels have three sets of eyelids and two rows of eyelashes to keep sand out of their eyes.</p>
                    <p>Camels have thick lips which let them forage for thorny plants other animals can't eat.</p>
                    <p>Camels can reach 7 feet in height (at the hump) and weigh up to 1500 pounds.</p>
